Find the nearest intersection between two crossed wires from the outlet

#### Part 2:
Find the combined shortest path of the two wires to an intersection


## Day 4: Secure Container
#### Part 1:
Get the number of possible password given the set of rules for a password

#### Part 2:
Added rule about two adjecent digits cant be part of bigger chunk.


## Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids
#### Part 1:
Expand intcode computer from day 2 to support opcode 3(input), opcode 4(ouput) and different parameter modes

#### Part 2:
Extend the computer with new operation codes: less, jump if true, jump if false and equals


## Day 6: Universal Orbit Map
#### Part 1:
Find the number of direct and indirect orbits based on a input. A tree structure where e.g. A orbits B and B orbits C .. meaning A indirectly orbits C

#### Part 2:
Find the shortest path between yourself and santa using orbital transfers


## Day 7: Amplification Circuit
#### Part 1:
Find the maximum output from 5 amplifiers(intcoders) connect together based on permutations. output from A goes to input in B etc..

#### Part 2:
Loop the output from last amplifier to the first, and run untill all exits by a code 99 and get the largets output


## Day 8: Space Image Format
#### Part 1:
Find the number of twos and ones in the pixel layer with fewest zeros

#### Part 2:
Decode the message by stacking layers on top. transparrent if 2

## Day 9: Sensor Boost
#### Part 1:
Extend the intcode computer to handle relative parameter mode, pluss opcode 9(set relative base). Also new features such as larger memory then initial program.

#### Part 2:
Test with other input values to computer


## Day 10: Monitoring Station
#### Part 1:
Find the location to build the monitoring station that is able to observe the most astroids from one place.

#### Part 2:
Calculate The destruction order of a laser beam fired from the monitoring station.


## Day 11: Space Police
#### Part 1:
Build a robot moving on a grid painting either black or white. Color and movement is based on output from intcode computer.

#### Part 2:
Change the starting field to white and fetch crypted message inside the paint.

## Day 13: Care Package
#### Part 1:
Intcode program draws blocks, walls, ball and paddle. How many blocks are there?

#### Part 2:
Part 2 is to play the game(spoiler; it is breakout).

## Day 14: Space Stoichiometry
#### Part 1:
given a list of reactions between stuff find the number of ORE needed to get 1 FUEL unit

#### Part 2:
If we have 1 trillion ORE how much fuel can we make, given the same reactions?

## Day 15: Oxygen System
#### Part 1:
Find the shortest path from the starting position of the repaire droid to the broken oxygen tank

#### Part 2:
The oxygen is filling the roooms. Get the number of timesteps before everything is filled

## Day 16: Flawed Frequency Transmission
#### Part 1:
Calculate output for each phase based on rules and input list. What is the 8 first digits after 100 phases?

#### Part 2:
Multiply the input times 10000 and do the same. Brute force wont work. Have to be smart.

## Day 17: Set and Forget
#### Part 1:
Vacuum bot moving outside the ship on scaffolds. get the number of intersections of scaffolds. 

#### Part 2:
get the path the bot has to take to cover everything. Must p√• compressed into Main, A, B, C. Intcode program has limit of 20 chars.


## Day 18: Many-Worlds Interpretation
#### Part 1:
Find all the keys in the maze in the shortest possible way. Need keys to go passed doors to get other keys

#### Part 2:
Find all the keys, except there are 4 robots working in each own section of the maze

## Day 19: Tractor Beam
#### Part 1:
How many points are affected by the tractor beam in a 50x50 area

#### Part 2:
Get the index of the 100x100 tractor beam square closest to the emitter
![Alt text](./day19/plot.gif)


## Day 20: Donut Maze
#### Part 1:
Find the shortest path through the donut/portal maze
