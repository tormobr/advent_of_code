# Advent of code 2019
## Solution for the advent of code problems 2019
In each subdir there is solution, input and sometimes a more pretty solution

## Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation
#### Part 1:
calculate fuel for modules

#### Part 2:
calculate the fuel for added fuel

## Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm
#### Part 1:
Get the output from intcode computer with 1202 input alarm

#### Part 2:
Find the input combination of noun and verb that gives specific output

## Day 3: Crossed Wires
#### Part 1:
Find the nearest intersection between two crossed wires from the outlet

#### Part 2:
Find the combined shortest path of the two wires to an intersection


## Day 4: Secure Container
#### Part 1:
Get the number of possible password given the set of rules for a password

#### Part 2:
Added rule about two adjecent digits cant be part of bigger chunk.


## Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids
#### Part 1:
Expand intcode computer from day 2 to support opcode 3(input), opcode 4(ouput) and different parameter modes

#### Part 2:
Extend the computer with new operation codes: less, jump if true, jump if false and equals


## Day 6: Universal Orbit Map
#### Part 1:
Find the number of direct and indirect orbits based on a input. A tree structure where e.g. A orbits B and B orbits C .. meaning A indirectly orbits C

#### Part 2:
Find the shortest path between yourself and santa using orbital transfers


## Day 7: Amplification Circuit
#### Part 1:
Find the maximum output from 5 amplifiers(intcoders) connect together based on permutations. output from A goes to input in B etc..

#### Part 2:
Loop the output from last amplifier to the first, and run untill all exits by a code 99 and get the largets output


## Day 8: Space Image Format
#### Part 1:
Find the number of twos and ones in the pixel layer with fewest zeros

#### Part 2:
Decode the message by stacking layers on top. transparrent if 2


## Day 9: Sensor Boost
#### Part 1:
Extend the intcode computer to handle relative parameter mode, pluss opcode 9(set relative base). Also new features such as larger memory then initial program.

#### Part 2:
Test with other input values to computer


## Day 10: Monitoring Station
#### Part 1:
Find the location to build the monitoring station that is able to observe the most astroids from one place.

#### Part 2:
Calculate The destruction order of a laser beam fired from the monitoring station.


## Day 11: Space Police
#### Part 1:
